# postal.socketio v0.1.0

###What is it?
postal.socketio is a [postal.federation](https://github.com/postaljs/postal.federation) add-on, allowing instances of postal in node.js and browser clients to 'federate' via [socket.io](http://socket.io/) and share messages, etc.

###Caveat Emptor
This is highly experimental and probably isn't ready for run-of-the-mill production. We welcome your feedback, but advise you to expect issues.
